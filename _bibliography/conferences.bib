	abstract = {{UV} radiation can cause dimerization of adjacent pyrimidinone bases in the {DNA}, consequences of which can be cell death or mutations. One of these damages, the P(6-4)P photolesion, is known to be suject to secondary photochemistry, namely the Dewar valence isomerization ({DVI} from the singlet state.
Relying on 1-methyl-2(1H)-pyrimidinone (1MP) as a model for the "chromophore" of P(6-4)P we here investigate the fate of the triplet excitation. Triplet yields of the compound are in the order of several ten percent. {CW} illumination and nanosecond laser flash experiments show that triplet excited 1MP can abstract hydrogen atoms from 2-deoxy-D-ribose, a constituent of {DNA}. The findings complement a recent study which stated that P86-4)P might act as a triplet-triplet energy donor.},
