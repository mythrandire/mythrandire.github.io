	abstract = {(6-4) Photolesions between adjacent pyrimidine {DNA} bases are prone to secondary photochemistry. It has been shown that singlet excited (6-4) moieties form Dewar valence isomers as well as triplet excitations. We here report on the triplet state of a minimal model for the (6-4) photolesion, 1-methyl-2(1H)-pyrimidinone. Emphasis is laid on its ability to abstract hydrogen atoms from alcohols and carbohydrates. Steady-state and time-resolved experiments consistently yield bimolecular rate constants of ∼104 M−1 s−1 for the hydrogen abstraction. The process also occurs intramolecularly as experiments on zebularine (1-(β-d-ribofuranosyl)-2(1H)-pyrimidinone) show.},

	abstract = {Self-healing materials have been intensively investigated in recent decades, whereby the healing process was mostly based on the restoration of mechanical properties after mechanical damage. However, self-healing functional polymeric materials have now become the focus of research. In recent years, several approaches have been developed for self-healing of conductivity as well as the restoration of optical properties. In contrast to the healing of mechanical properties, such as stiffness and strength, the self-healing of functional materials focuses on the restoration of functionalities after damage caused by harmful environments (e.g., high temperatures or irradiation). The ultimate goal is the investigation or mimicking of a multifunctional self-healing system (e.g., biological material). In this review, the current state of the art in self-healing functional polymeric materials is summarized. In particular, we discuss self-healing conductive materials, healable optoelectronics, and functional coatings.},

Subsequently, the exchange of the side chain chromophores between the prepared donor and acceptor graft polymers in the solid state based on a reversible Diels–Alder reaction was studied in detail. The resulting donor–acceptor graft copolymer exhibits intra polymer energy transfer upon excitation of the donor moiety. The photophysical properties of the original and exchanged graft copolymers were investigated by means of absorption and emission spectroscopy.

One promising strategy to enable strong interchromophoric interactions is the introduction of hydrogen-bonding moieties. Together with the tendency of the chromophores to self-assemble via π–π-stacking a dense packing of the chromophores within a polymer film can be achieved. In order to demonstrate this strategy, oligo(phenylene ethynylene)s are used as monomers for copolymers using the highly efficient blocked isocyanate route and polymer films are prepared by spin coating technique. The copolymers are prepared by an in situ deprotection of a pyrazol protected bis-isocyanate functionalized rigid chromophore followed by subsequent polyaddition using a bis-amine or bis-alcohol linker unit. The specific introduction of urea as well as urethane moieties enhances coplanarization of the chromophores in the polymer films into well-organized structures, which can be characterized based on their specific optical properties.},

	abstract = {The thesis at hand deals with the spectroscopic and photophysical characterization of dynamically linked polymers, so called dynamers. Dynamers have already found extensive use in the fields of sensor systems or self-healing materials, but the combination of their dynamic chemistry with optical properties such as absorption or emission is still an open field of research. The present thesis is divided in three main parts. First, dynamers that rely on the Diels-Alder functionality were investigated by steady-state and time-resolved, i.e. transient absorption and time-resolved emission, spectroscopies. The chromophores embedded in the polymer scaffold belonged to the class of oligo(arylene ethynylene)s, which are known for their pronounced emission properties. In particular, the influence of the dynamer structure on their ground- and excited state properties both in solution as well as in thin films was studied. Additionally, energy transfer experiments in different polymer compositions were conducted. Second, an imine based polymer was probed with regards to its photostability. Utilizing different excitation energies and solvent properties, different photochemical deactivation pathways were found. Last, an imine-based polymer system was investigated that could partially self-heal its absorption properties after photodamage. Different polymer sructures which affected polymer mobility in films were tested and general rules for the design of optically active self-healing polymers were derived. Keywords: dynamic polymers, dynamic chemistry, self-healing, time-resolved spectroscopy, transient absorption spectroscopy, energy transfer, arylene ethynylene, phenylene ethynylene, photoisomerization, photooxidation.},

	abstract = {In this study, the impact of the type of ligand at the surface of colloidal {CdSe}@{CdS} dot-in-rod nanostructures on the basic exciton relaxation and charge localization processes is closely examined. These systems have been introduced into the field of artificial photosynthesis as potent photosensitizers in assemblies for light driven hydrogen generation. Following photoinduced exciton generation, electrons can be transferred to catalytic reaction centers while holes localize into the {CdSe} seed, which can prevent charge recombination and lead to the formation of long-lived charge separation in assemblies containing catalytic reaction centers. These processes are in competition with trapping processes of charges at surface defect sites. The density and type of surface defects strongly depend on the type of ligand used. Here we report on a systematic steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopic investigation of the impact of the type of anchoring group (phosphine oxide, thiols, dithiols, amines) and the bulkiness of the ligand (alkyl chains vs. poly(ethylene glycol) ({PEG})) to unravel trapping pathways and localization efficiencies. We show that the introduction of the widely used thiol ligands leads to an increase of hole traps at the surface compared to trioctylphosphine oxide ({TOPO}) capped rods, which prevent hole localization in the {CdSe} core. On the other hand, steric restrictions, e.g., in dithiolates or with bulky side chains ({PEG}), decrease the surface coverage, and increase the density of electron trap states, impacting the recombination dynamics at the ns timescale. The amines in poly(ethylene imine) ({PEI}) on the other hand can saturate and remove surface traps to a wide extent. Implications for catalysis are discussed.},

Nanohybrid structures such as {CdSe}@{CdS}-Pt nanorods were found favorable for this task (attaining 100\% photon-to-hydrogen production efficiency); yet the rods cannot support overall water splitting. The key limitation seems to be the rate of hole extraction from the semiconductor, jeopardizing both activity and stability. It is suggested that hole extraction might be improved via tuning the rod’s dimensions, specifically the width of the {CdS} shell around the {CdSe} seed in which the holes reside. In this contribution, we successfully attain atomic-scale control over the width of {CdSe}@{CdS} nanorods, which enables us to verify this hypothesis and explore the intricate influence of shell diameter over hole quenching and photocatalytic activity towards H2 production. A non-monotonic effect of the rod’s diameter is revealed, and the underlying mechanism for this observation is discussed, alongside implications towards the future design of nanoscale photocatalysts.},

	abstract = {Colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals, in particular cadmium and lead chalcogenide particles, are pivotal materials in many optoelectronic applications. While synthetic advances in the past decades now allow precise control of their size, shape, and composition, they must be processed from dispersion into functional films for many applications, which presents additional challenges. In this review, recent progresses in the field of nanoparticle self-assembly into functional thin films with precise control over nanoparticle order and orientation are discussed. A comprehensive overview on characterization methods used in the study of such ordered materials is provided and the gas–liquid interfacial self-assembly and electric field driven deposition as the two most promising ways to generate superstructures with defined thickness, order, and orientation are discussed. The superstructure–property relationships are then reviewed with emphasis on charge migration through the film and radiative processes. Last, challenges and open questions in the field are addressed.},

	abstract = {{CdSe} quantum dots combined with [{FeFe}] hydrogenase mimics as molecular catalytic reaction centers based on earth abundant elements have demonstrated promising activity for photocatalytic hydrogen generation. Direct linking of the [{FeFe}] hydrogenase mimics to the quantum dots surface is expected to enhance the activity of the system by establishing close contact between the [{FeFe}] hydrogenase mimics and the light harvesting quantum dots supporting the transfer and accumulation of several electrons which are needed to drive hydrogen evolution. To circumvent the problem of limited colloidal stability upon covalent functionalization of the quantum dots under optimal {pH} conditions for hydrogen evolution, in this work, we report on the functionalization of quantum dots immobilized in a thin film architecture on a substrate with [{FeFe}] hydrogenase mimics by covalent linking via carboxylate groups as anchoring functionality to bind to the {QD} surface. The functionalization was monitored via {UV}/Vis absorption, photoluminescence, infrared ({ATR}-{FTIR}) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ({XPS}) and quantified via micro X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (μ{XRF}). The activity of the molecularly functionalized thin film was demonstrated and in dependence on the linker length {TONs} in the range of 360-580 (short linker) and 130-160 (long linker) were achieved. This work presents a proof of concept study showing the potential of thin film architectures of immobilized quantum dots as platform for light-driven hydrogen evolution and beyond.},

	abstract = {Colloidal nanorods based on {CdS} or {CdSe} functionalized with metal particles have proven to be efficient catalysts for light driven hydrogen evolution. Seeded {CdSe}@{CdS} nanorods have shown increasing performance with increasing rod length. This observation was rationalized by the increasing lifetime of the separated charges, as a large distance between holes localized in the {CdSe} seed and electrons localized at the metal tip decreases their recombination rate. However, the impact of nanorod length on electron-to-tip localization efficiency or pathway remained an open question. Therefore, we investigated the photo-induced electron transfer to the metal in a series of Ni tipped {CdSe}@{CdS} nanorods with varying length. We find that the transfer processes occurring from the region close to the semiconductor-metal interface, the rod region, and the {CdSe} seed region depend in different ways on the rods length. The rate of the fastest process from excitonic states generated directly at the interface is independent of the rod length but the relative amplitude decreases with increasing rod length as the weight of the interface region is decreasing. The transfer of electrons to the metal tip from excitons generated in the {CdS} rod region depends strongly on the length of the nanorods which indicates an electron transport limited process, i.e., electron diffusion towards the interface region followed by fast interface crossing. The transfer originating from {CdSe} excitonic states again shows no significant length dependence in its time constant as it is probably limited by the rate of overcoming the shallow confinement in the {CdSe} seed.},
