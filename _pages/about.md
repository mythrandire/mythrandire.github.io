Hello there! I'm Dr. Mathias Micheel, a postdoctoral scientist currently employed at the Leibniz-Institute of Photonic Technology in Jena, Germany. On this website, you may find more about my research and myself. From time to time, I might even drop random thoughts here - just like it was my personal blog in 2004!

> *And if in a distant future the supply of coal becomes completely exhausted,
civilization will not be checked by that, for life and civilization will continue as
long as the sun shines! â€“ Giacomo Ciamician (1912). The photochemistry of the future. Science, 36(926), 385-394. doi: [10.1126/science.36.926.385](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.36.926.385)*

More than 100 years ago, Ciamician expressed his vision of a civilization which covers its energy needs not on the basis of coal (which he called *fossil solar energy*), but by direct utilization of solar energy. Instead of smokestacks from coal and oil factories, the chemical industry of the future will use glass tubes to drive their reactions. As a child from the Ruhr area, with its long history in coal mining and steel refining, I am every much committed to realizing his dream, which remains unfulfilled to date, and try to convert solar energy into so-called *solar fuels*.

At the moment, my research interest revolves around colloidal semiconductor nanoparticles, which can absorb visible sun light, their light-induced interaction with redoxactive molecules and polymers. In particular, I consider myself an expert in the spectroscopic characterization by means of time-resolved and steady state absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopies to investigate charge separation, localization and recombination processes in these structures in timescales from hundreds of femtoseconds to dozens of nanoseconds.
