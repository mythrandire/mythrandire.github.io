Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

More than 100 years ago, Ciamician expressed his vision of a civilization which covers its energy needs not on the basis of coal (which he called *fossil solar energy*), but by direct utilization of solar energy. Instead of smokestacks from coal and oil factories, the chemical industry of the future will use glass tubes to drive their reactions. As a child from the Ruhr area, with its long history in coal mining and steel refining, I am every much committed to realizing his dream, which remains unfulfilled to date, and try to convert solar energy into so-called *solar fuels*. As such, I specialized in the optical characterization of semiconductor and polymer nanoparticles and the investigation of light-driven chemical reactions.
