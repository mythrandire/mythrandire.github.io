> *During my time as a graduate student at Columbia University's School of Engineering & Applied Science, I had the privilege of being involved in teaching alongside Prof. Zoran Kostic as a teaching assistant for his courses. On this page you will find details about the responsibilities I shouldered and links to selected teaching material I created in this capacity.*

| Course Instructor | Semester(s) | Year |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ---- |
| Prof. Zoran Kositc| Fall        | 2020 |


### Responsibilites

* Course assistance through guided examples and teaching hours.
* Assignment creation: design challenging assignments to test OpenCL and CUDA programming concepts taught for the course.
* Assignment, exam and project grading.

### Teaching Material

I do not have permission to expose most of the course material I created for these courses, but the introductory notebooks on OpenCL and CUDA are basic enough that I feel comfortable sharing them here:
* [An Introduction to PyCUDA](https://github.com/mythrandire/e4750_intro_notebooks/blob/main/pycuda_intro.ipynb)
* [An Introduction to PyOpenCL](https://github.com/mythrandire/e4750_intro_notebooks/blob/main/pyopencl_intro.ipynb)

## Misc. Teaching Material

### [ECBM E6040: Neural Networks and Deep Learning Research](https://www.aidl.ee.columbia.edu/documents/neuralnetworksanddeeplearningresearch)

This course was fluidly taught through the medium of regular lectures and guest speakers. Occasionally, students would be tasked with preparing a full lecture on an interesting paper or concept. I contributed with two sessions: a primer on adversarial learning, and a deep dive of the Single-Shot Multi-box Detector (SSD) for object localization/detection. 

My notes on the SSD are lost. If I find them, I'll include them here. The Jupyter Notebook on Adversarial Learning is readily available though:
