      description:
        - title: Perception Team
          contents:
          - Wrote a point cloud registration benchmark utilizing simple raycasting in Open3D.
          - Co-developed a 3D point cloud stitching algorithm using relative transforms from point-to-plane ICP to build a pose graph. Pruning false edges with uncertain alignment yielded true alignment between point clouds.
          - Assumed code ownership of the point cloud stitching ROS service. Handled field error reports and bugfixes. 
        - title: Adaptive Welding Team
          contents:
          - Wrote an algorithm designed to find the closest interaction point for 2 near-orthogonal non-planar surfaces. (2D cross-section of a mesh).
          - Spearheaded a major refactor of Path's adaptive welding software stack. This transitioned the software from pre-release to true production-ready status, improving maintainability and stability. This kept the release stable in production until version 2 was developed.
        - Successfully led several RaaS (Robotics-as-a-Service) deployments of <a href="https://www.path-robotics.com/robotic-welding-systems/the-robots/aw3/">autonomous welding cells</a> worth millions in revenue.

      year: May '21 - Feb 2022
      description:
        - Rescued a prototype IPTV capturing backend with expert use of FFMPEG, Docker and cron management. Reduced server outages by 20%, dropping the recording failure rate from 40% to 7%. 
        - Worked on video-scene change detection with graph-based community detection.

          contents:
          - Led an analytical study† on real-time object tracking with YOLOv4, to define and measure the effect of three parameters against inference mean average precision (mAP) - scene complexity/object density, video resolution, and framerate. This work was published in proceedings of the 19th IEEE International Conference on Smart City, Dec 2021.
          - Explored accelerated Mask R-CNN inference with TensorRT and <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk">NVIDIA DeepStream</a>. Performance differentiators were identified through CUDA profiling.

        - Medical Advisor - Dr. M. L. Murali Krishna
        - title: Image Processing Project
          contents:
          - Wrote an image processing library in Python to pre-process medical image data (retinal images, ultrasound images).
          - This work focused on multi-scale image processing (gaussian pyramids) and an image structure tensor derived from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riesz_transform">Riesz Transform</a>.
        - title: Deep Learning Projects
          contents:
          - Developed a segmentation system using U-Nets to identify features of pathological interest in fundus images (i.e. of the retina), such as vasculature, lipid deposits, optic disc etc. 
          - Co-created a 3-stage Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) Severity prediction tool, utilizing U-Net segmentation to localize hard exudates and lipid deposits on the retina. The relative proximity and frequency of these exudates to the fovea determines the clinical severity of DME. 
        - title: Graphic Design Project
          contents:
          - Created a cohesive design language using <a href="https://m1.material.io/">M1 Material Design</a> principles for a pre-screening app for retinal image scans. This app was designed to be used by ophthalmologists and eye surgeons to screen medical images for pathologies using Spectrum Lab's research-backed detection algorithms.
          - This app was eventually <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/spectrumlabeeiisc/album?authuser=0">demoed</a> (with the same design) by Spectrum Lab at the G20 Science Summit in India (2023).
