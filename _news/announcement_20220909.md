I have been elected co-representative of the [young Physical Chemists (yPC)](https://bunsen.de/ypc), the early career researcher organization of the Deutsche Bunsen-Gesellschaft, from 2022 to 2024!

***

I am more than happy to take over from Maria WÃ¤chtler who will start working as a full professor at TU Kaiserslautern from October on. I am eager to bring yPC to the next level as a great way for young graduate and PhD students as well as postdocs to network and learn. In particular, I want to deepen our relationship with the JCF, the junge DPG and other early career organizations. Let's go!
