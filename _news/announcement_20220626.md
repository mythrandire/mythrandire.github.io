[New preprint](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2022-n5wb1) on ChemRxiv! We directly functionalized thin CdSe quantum dot films with mlecular hydrogenase mimics and provided in-depth characterization of the functionalization and catalytic activity. Great collaboration between Leibniz-IPHT, Uni Jena, and Uni Ulm!
